## Some more atributes of Label
### Atributes fo Label
<table>

    <th style="padding-right:30px;">Atributes of Label</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>text</td>
    <td>Adds text to the label</td>

    <td>Baground</td>

### Usage of atributes

So now we have seen some atributes for the widgets of tkinter now let's try them out.

``` python
from tkinter import *
from PIL import *
window = Tk()
window.geometry("500x500")
Label(
        text='Hello there! I am trying some attributes of tk. ', 
        relief= SUNKEN, 
        bg="red",
        fg="green", 
        font=('comicsansms',10), 
        padx=60, 
        pady= 50
     ).pack()
mainloop()
```
After running that code you will see this window.
<img src="/assets/img/post_img/atribute.png">

You can use more options<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> for relief <sup id="a1">[2](#f1)</sup> 
> **Important**: For font attribute first create a tuple, give the font name as the first argument in string and second font size in number.


## Showing image
Like label image is a widget which does not interact with user.
So let's guess that you have two images called photo.png and photo.jpg and I want to show them on the window so for that I will do like this :
```python
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()
window.geometry("500x500")
photo = PhotoImage(file = "photo.png")
Label(image = photo).pack()
mainloop()
```

After running this code you will get an image in the window, remember that the file is png file.  
  
Now change the `file = "photo.png"` in line number 4 to `file = "photo.jpg"` and run it again you think that it will work... oh.. o it does not work. You will yell that it is giving me a error like this :
``` python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/amp/PycharmProjects/Calculator/calculator.py", line 4, in <module>
    photo = PhotoImage(file = "photo.jpg")
  File "/usr/lib64/python3.8/tkinter/__init__.py", line 4061, in __init__
    Image.__init__(self, 'photo', name, cnf, master, **kw)
  File "/usr/lib64/python3.8/tkinter/__init__.py", line 4006, in __init__
    self.tk.call(('image', 'create', imgtype, name,) + options)
_tkinter.TclError: couldn't recognize data in image file "photo.jpg"
```

Don't worry, in future pyhton updates it should be done, **hey but we are in hurry we want it now** so for that instance we are doing something like this 
we import a module called PIL for Python Imaging Library like this `from PIL import Image, ImageTk` thats not all it will definitely not work
 write some code like this:

```python
from tkinter import *
from PIL import ImageTk, Image
window = Tk()
window.geometry("500x500")
img = Image.open("photo.jpg")
photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img)
Label(image = photo).pack()
mainloop()
```

Now it is definitely work.

### Explanation
* The PhotoImage function takes a image file and store that image in a variable. 
* The image in label function shows a image which is stored in an variable. If you directly enter the path to the image in `image` atribute of label function it does not work. 
* The PIL(Python Imaging Library)'s Image.open function opens a jpg image.
* The ImageTk.PhotoImage function returns inserts a jpg image into a variable.
